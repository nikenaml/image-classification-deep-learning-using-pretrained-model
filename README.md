# image-classification-deep-learning-using-pretrained-model

In this case study, I combine several subcategories of the same clothing into one category (not by clothing color, but by clothing type). The result of merging these subcategories is that there are several main categories which are divided into 5 categories, namely Dress, Pants, Shirt, Shoes, Shorts. I'm trying to learn and build a deep learning approach with CNN Architecture using a model that has been pre-trained to fit the data and then used to predict the image data.
